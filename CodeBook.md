Code Book for Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This CodeBook file describes the variables, the data, transformations and work that I performed to clean up the data.

This link has the description of the original data. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

I used the following files from the data set in the project:
1. y_test.txt - test labels (number 1 to 6, maps to activity labels, 2947 records)
2. X_test.txt - test data set (561 variables, 2947 records)
3. y_train.txt - training labels (number 1 to 6, maps to activity labels, 7352 records)
4. X_train.txt - training data set (561 variables, 7352 records)
5. activity_labels.txt - links the 6 class labels with their activity name (1-walking, 2-walking_upstairs, 3-walking_downstairs, 4-sitting, 5-standing, 6-laying)
6. features.txt - list of the different features (561 records) (e.g. tGravityAcc-std())
7. subject_train.txt - lists the individual subjects for the training data records
8. subject_test.txt - lists the individual subjects for the test data records
