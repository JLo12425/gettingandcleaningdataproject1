Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

There are two files in the repository associated with this project:

The "run_analysis.R" file runs the following scripts from the project instructions and outputs the final tidy data set in #5. 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The "CodeBook.md" file describes the variables, the data, transformations and work that I performed to clean up the data.
